# Information Visualization
This is my works on Information Visualization which includes:

## Google sheets with Charts and publish with HTML
* The Topic: Economic Growth and CO2 Emissions. 
> Is it the price of gross domestic product (GDP) growth?  Total 10 countries are selected to be comparison.

## Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) Drawing practice for Bubble chart
* The Topic: CO2 Emissions per GDP. 
> Create and publish a bubble cloud in three different ways. Use node.js and browsersync to develop and explain how to start the web server.
> Create three bubble charts in one HTML document:
> * SVG Prototype: pick one attribute from UN Data for 10 countries and create a bubble cloud with Inkscape as an SVG prototype in prototype.svg. Put in index.html.
> * SVG Code: manually recreate the same bubble cloud by writing SVG code in index.html (i.e., writing SVG yourself, not re-using the SVG created by Inkscape!). Use a style.css file.
> * Dynamic SVG: recreate the same bubble cloud using JavaScript (i.e., dynamically generating the SVG). Use a chart.js file.
