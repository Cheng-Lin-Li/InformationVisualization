# Information Visualization
This is my works on Information Visualization which includes:

## 1. Google sheets with Charts and publish with HTML
* The Topic: Economic Growth and CO2 Emissions. 
> Is it the price of gross domestic product (GDP) growth?  Total 10 countries are selected to be comparison.
>
> Click ** [Here](https://github.com/Cheng-Lin-Li/InformationVisualization/tree/master/GoogleSheets) ** to explore the results.

## 2. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) Drawing practice for Bubble chart
* The Topic: CO2 Emissions per GDP. 
> Create and publish a bubble cloud in three different ways. Use node.js and browsersync to develop and explain how to start the web server.
> Create three bubble charts in one HTML document:
> * SVG Prototype: pick one attribute from UN Data for 10 countries and create a bubble cloud with Inkscape as an SVG prototype in prototype.svg. Put in index.html.
> * SVG Code: manually recreate the same bubble cloud by writing SVG code in index.html (i.e., writing SVG yourself, not re-using the SVG created by Inkscape!). Use a style.css file.
> * Dynamic SVG: recreate the same bubble cloud using JavaScript (i.e., dynamically generating the SVG). Use a chart.js file.

## 3. Inforgraphics analyze by Visualization Wheels
* The Subject: Global Carbon Budget.
> Find 2 different infographics on the same subject, Global Carbon Budget, by different approaches. 
>
> Compare these two infographics by visualization wheels to analysis Pros and Cons, suggest improvements for the things they do poorly.

## 4. R language with ggplot 2 and plotly packages
* The Topic: Transponder flight data analysis of Santa Monica VOR(SMOVOR) by R with ggplot2 and plotly packages.
>The scope of the analysis is to see if there are any quantifiable differences between before/after Columbus day (Monday, October 12th, 2015) - an oft cited milestone for recent changes in noise.

## 5. D3 with data binding
* The Topic: Present Rural population (% of total population) data for 20 countries in 2016 by a stem-and-leaf plot, a bar chart, and a scatterplot.
