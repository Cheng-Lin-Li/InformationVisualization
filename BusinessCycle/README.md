# BusinessCycle

This project was generated based on [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.9.

## Technology

This project leverages Angular v4 as application framework and Bootstrap v4 for responsive design. I worked with my teammates, Yucheng Guo and Sovan Rath to develop. This project includes D3 donut chart, line charts, stream chart, choropleth world map and heat map to introduce business cycle and its impact.

I implemented donut chart, theory line chart and build the application architecture which integrated our application components into Angular framework with Bootstrap template.
