# BusinessCycle
This project builds up a web application to introduce what business cycle is and how it will impact to us. We may also use this visualization to predict the economic trend of the future.
The project was generated based on [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.9.

## Technology

This project leverages Angular v4 as application framework and Bootstrap v4 for responsive design. I worked with my teammates, Yucheng Guo and Sovan Rath to develop. This project includes D3 donut chart, line charts, stream chart, choropleth world map and heat map to introduce business cycle and its impact.

I implemented donut chart, theory line chart and build the application architecture which integrated our application components into Angular framework with Bootstrap template.

Alternative approach is download the folder into your local PC, click the index.html page via firefox or Microsoft Edge. Google Chrome cannot execute this application due to cross origin requests for data file access security restrictions. Or you can add parameter "--allow-file-access-from-files" when you execute chrome. For example: 
```text
chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files
```
to grant the access.
